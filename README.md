# Google_Takeout_data_mining
Knowledge extraction from Google Takeout

The amount of data we produce every day is growing exponentially. Especially from smartphones, which contain a multitude of sophisticated sensors, from barometers and gyroscopes to GPS navigation and ambient light sensors. All of these technologies provide mobile data collection methods for apps so they can use your data to enrich your user experience. 

TakeOut by Google allows you to export your Google products. Exports are available as zip formatted downloads. Downloads may be very time consuming - Google will notify you via email after downloads are complete.

Google TakeOut can be found [here](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout).

You can export and download your data from the Google products you use, such as your:

    - Email
    - Documents
    - Calendar 
    - Photos
    - YouTube videos
    - Data about registration and account activity
    - ...


This project aims to illustrate how the huge amount of data collected by Google, could be used to improve user experience but is also a door open on user private life 

Please, check the content of your Google TakeOut and use our notebooks to investigating how collection data could be used by GAAFA or Netflix, or other companies owner of applications you use.
